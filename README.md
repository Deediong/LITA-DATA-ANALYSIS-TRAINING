Project Overview
This Excel documentation aims at letting others go through my journey in learning Data Analysis with LITA (Ladies In Tech Africa) at The Incubator Hub. This documentation will help you navigate through Excel like a pro.

Data Sources
A dummy dataset was used for this analysis to demonstrate data wrangling and insight creation using data validation in Excel, Excel functions like VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, CONCATENATE, SUM, AVERAGE, TRIM, PROPER, etc. SQL, and Power BI. The goal is to identify key trends and correlations, showcasing the effectiveness of data visualization in informing business decisions.
